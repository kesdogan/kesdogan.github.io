We model the dynamics of a garment by exploiting its local interactions with the underlying human body. Specifically, as the body moves, we detect local garment-body collisions, which drive the deformation of the garment. At the core of our approach is a mesh-agnostic garment representation and a manifold-aware transformer network design, which together enable our method to generalize to unseen garment and body geometries.
