GarmentCodeData contains 115,000 data points that cover a variety of designs in many common garment categories: tops, shirts, dresses, jumpsuits, skirts, pants, etc., fitted to a variety of body shapes sampled from a custom statistical body model based on CAESAR, as well as a standard reference body shape, applying three different textile materials.
